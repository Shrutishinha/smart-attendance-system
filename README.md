# FINGERPRINT ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FLASK)

A WEB-BASED FINGERPRINT ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM BUILT USING PYTHON FLASK AND SQLITE. THIS APPLICATION ALLOWS ADMINISTRATORS TO MANAGE STUDENTS, MARK ATTENDANCE, AND GENERATE REPORTS THROUGH A SECURE AND USER-FRIENDLY WEB INTERFACE.

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

THIS SYSTEM PROVIDES A DIGITAL PLATFORM FOR MANAGING STUDENT ATTENDANCE USING A SIMULATED FINGERPRINT AUTHENTICATION PROCESS. IT HELPS IN REDUCING MANUAL ERRORS, IMPROVING DATA ACCURACY, AND GENERATING DETAILED REPORTS.

---

## FEATURES

- SECURE ADMIN LOGIN SYSTEM  
- STUDENT MANAGEMENT (ADD, EDIT, DELETE, VIEW)  
- CLASS MANAGEMENT  
- ATTENDANCE MARKING (FINGERPRINT SIMULATION)  
- ATTENDANCE REPORTS AND STATISTICS  
- SQLITE DATABASE INTEGRATION  
- RESPONSIVE WEB INTERFACE  
- SESSION-BASED AUTHENTICATION  
- CSV EXPORT SUPPORT (OPTIONAL)
